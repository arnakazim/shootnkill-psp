# Shoot'N'Kill, a Sony PSP minigame

I have written Shoot'N'Kill around 2009. It was a game intended to show your reflexes on the Sony PSP. Not sure if it reaches this goal but it was good enough for me when I was 15 😂.

At this time, the sources where compile before copied the game on my PSP-2000. Today, I have lost the original sources but still have my PSP with Shoot'N'Kill in the Memory Stick. Since I have always wanted to improve this game I have, in 2020, decompiled the game and recovered the sources! 😃

Enjoy Shoot'N'Kill and feel free to reuse the sources. If anybody still code for PSP in 2020... 🤷‍♀️
